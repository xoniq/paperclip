/**
 * E2E: Onboarding wizard flow (NUX Phase 2 expanded wizard).
 *
 * The wizard now opens on a front door (path picker) and the "Create a new
 * company" path runs:
 *   Step 0  — Front door (Create a new company / Level up existing)
 *   Step 1a — Name your organization (creates the company)
 *   Step 2  — Hire your team lead (adapter picker)
 *   Step 3+ — Launch celebration → CEO chat → hiring plan → orientation
 *
 * This test covers the deterministic, LLM-free core: it drives the front door
 * through company naming (which creates the company) and verifies the wizard
 * advances to the team-lead step without asking for a mission.
 *
 * The tail (CEO chat at step 4, hiring-plan generation at step 5, final
 * landing) depends on a live LLM and is verified separately during manual /
 * LLM-backed QA — see PAP-50. Surface-level rendering of every step is
 * snapshotted by nux-phase4-screenshots.spec.ts.
