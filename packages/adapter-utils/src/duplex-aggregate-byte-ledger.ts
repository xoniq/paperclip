/**
 * The process-owned aggregate byte ledger for the sandbox duplex channel.
 *
 * The route-count controller bounds how many concurrent duplex routes stay live.
 * It does not bound the aggregate bytes those routes retain. At the maximum route
 * count the per-route byte bounds multiply to many gigabytes of retained bytes.
 * This ledger closes that gap. One ledger per host server process owns a single
 * byte ceiling. Every host-side retention site reserves its exact retained bytes
 * against this ledger before it allocates, so the aggregate retained bytes across
 * all live routes never pass the ceiling.
 *
 * The ledger is fail-closed. A reservation that would pass the ceiling returns no
 * token. The caller retains nothing and reports the fixed rejection marker
 * {@link DUPLEX_CHANNEL_AGGREGATE_BYTES_EXCEEDED}.
 *
 * Ownership is transfer-only. A token holds an immutable byte amount, an owner
 * label from a closed enum, and a one-way state: `held` then `released`. The
 * ledger moves a token from one representation to the next with
 * {@link DuplexAggregateByteLedger.transfer}, which changes only the owner label.
 * It never decrements and re-reserves, so no admission gap opens between two
 * representations of the same retained bytes.
 *
 * The ledger holds every live token in one owner registry. Registry removal and
 * the release of a token run in one synchronous critical section, before any
 * `await` or external callback. A second release of the same token is an
 * accounting defect. The ledger records the fixed underflow counter and does not
 * clamp the gauge down a second time, so a real defect stays visible.
 *
 * The ledger carries no payload data and no arbitrary labels. It exposes only the
 * byte gauge, the live-token count, and the closed owner enum.

 *     route terminalization, held for a late listener drain.
 *   - `request_frame`: a bounded raw request frame the broker retains at dispatch.

 *   - `response_body`: a response-body chunk or replacement buffer the reader retains.
 *   - `seen_request_id`: one entry of the broker no-replay request-id set.
 *   - `decoder_buffer`: the raw partial-frame bytes the host frame decoder retains
 *     between chunks, plus the peak replacement buffer it allocates on concat.
 *   - `readiness_buffer`: the raw untrusted bytes the readiness gate retains before
 *     the READY frame completes, before the broker binds and the decoder takes over.
 *   - `readiness_replay`: the post-READY suffix bytes the readiness gate holds in the
 *     pending replay buffer, from the READY accept until the broker binds and the
 *     frame decoder charges its own retention. This is a separate retention from
 *     `readiness_buffer`: the gate drops the whole pre-READY buffer on READY, then
 *     charges only the retained suffix and each later pre-bind chunk under this owner.
 *   - `http2_preface_scan`: the raw untrusted bytes the `http2_v1` preface scan
 *     retains while it searches for the client connection preface, from the
 *     readiness-replay handoff until the preface match or the scan cap. This
 *     is a separate retention from `readiness_replay`: it starts only after
 *     the readiness gate hands its own retained suffix to the preface scan.
 *   - `http2_preface_replay`: the bytes the `http2_v1` preface scan holds after the
 *     client connection preface, from the preface match until the HTTP/2 server
 *     binds its downstream listener. This is a separate retention from
 *     `http2_preface_scan`: the scan drops its own buffer on the preface match,
 *     then charges only the retained suffix and each later pre-bind chunk under
 *     this owner.
 *   - `pending_write`: the raw host-to-worker write payload a pending duplex write
 *     RPC retains, from the enqueue seam until the RPC settles.
 *   - `stdin_write`: the serialized host-to-worker frame the child-stdin transport
 *     buffer retains, from the write until the stream flushes the chunk, the stream
 *     errors, the stream closes, or the worker exits. This is a separate retention
 *     from `pending_write`: the RPC holds the raw payload while the transport buffer
 *     holds the larger serialized frame, so the two tokens cover the peak of both.
