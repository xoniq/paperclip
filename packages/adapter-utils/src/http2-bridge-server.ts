/**
 * Host HTTP/2 server for the sandbox callback bridge transport.
 *
 * The server wraps one {@link CommandManagedDuplexChannel} as a Node `Duplex`
 * and runs one plaintext HTTP/2 session on it. It maps every stream on that
 * session to one call of the caller-supplied `forwardRequest` handler, then
 * writes the result back as the stream response. The handler applies the real
 * host token and the run attribution, so those rules stay in one place, next
 * to the existing file-bridge and duplex-bridge forward path.
 *
 * This file does not select the transport for a run. It builds and tests the
 * host half of the pair in isolation; a later phase wires the pair into the
 * transport-selection path.
 *
 * Requests flow from the sandbox to the host only: the host never opens a
 * stream to the sandbox. The server enforces three checks, in this order, for
 * every stream:
 *   1. a constant-time compare of the bridge token against the per-run token
 *      (accepted security fix 4), before any other processing;
 *   2. one canonical parse of the `:path` pseudo-header (accepted security fix
 *      3), whose result feeds both the route allowlist and the forward URL;
 *   3. the route allowlist and the header allowlist, reused unchanged from
 *      `sandbox-callback-bridge.ts`.
 * The server also bounds ten `http2.createServer` options (accepted security
 * fix 1), so Node enforces the session, header, and stream-reset limits on
 * every connection with no new component.

 * Wrap a {@link CommandManagedDuplexChannel} as a Node `Duplex`, so an

 * duplex)`). The wrapper never buffers more than one write in flight: it calls
 * the stream write callback only after the channel's own write call settles
 * (the backpressure constraint), never as a delivery signal. The provider
 * accepts many megabytes in milliseconds and holds them in its own buffer, so
 * this direction stays governed by the channel's own write-settle timing.
 *
 * The read direction needs its own bound. The channel exposes no pause: once
 * `onData` below is registered, the channel keeps calling it for every byte
 * the sandbox sends, with no way for this wrapper to slow it down. Node's
 * `Duplex.push()` reports back-pressure through its boolean return, not by
 * refusing the call, so a caller that ignores a `false` return and keeps
 * pushing grows the readable side's internal buffer with no limit. This
 * wrapper honors that signal instead: while `push()` reports room, it pushes
 * directly; once `push()` reports the readable side is full, it queues each
 * later chunk instead of pushing past that signal, and drains the queue from
 * `read()`, which Node calls again only once the consumer wants more. Every
 * chunk, on either path, first checks against
 * {@link DEFAULT_HTTP2_BRIDGE_MAX_BUFFERED_READ_BYTES} (or the caller's
 * `maxBufferedReadBytes`) on its own size, and the queue checks against the
 * same cap on its cumulative size: past either check the wrapper fails
 * closed instead of buffering further, because the channel has no pause to
 * fall back on. A second, independent bound —
 * {@link DEFAULT_HTTP2_BRIDGE_READ_BACKPRESSURE_STALL_MS} (or the caller's
 * `readBackpressureStallMs`) — covers the case the byte cap does not: a
 * consumer that stops reading entirely, so the queue never grows past the
 * byte cap but also never drains. This bound renews on every chunk the
 * queue drains, so a consumer that keeps making real progress never trips
 * it.
