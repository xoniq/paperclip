# Paperclip Runner

This private workspace package contains the staged Paperclip Runner work.

The package currently exposes the language-neutral PRP v1 TypeScript
contract, provider-neutral structured questions and responses, deterministic
fixture validation/replay, structured-result normalization, and the session
reducer oracle. It also contains a package-local Rust runner, scripted fake
harness, bounded process supervisor, cross-language replay oracle, and durable
PRP transport. The transport authenticates and encrypts loopback WebSocket
sessions, persists an ACK-driven outbox and command journal, and reconnects with
a short-lived lease. The Rust runner now includes a Codex-only app-server
provider bridge with durable thread resume, cancellation, structured questions,
and provider-neutral event normalization. The root surface now also exposes an
authenticated durable PRP authority for server-side use. It stores only
bootstrap and reconnect credential digests, validates immutable run identity on
every connection and event, and persists commands and cumulative event ACK
state across server restarts.
The package also publishes the canonical semantic action declarations and
their input and output schemas. Its package-local dispatcher projects only
bound, run-authorized actions and emits redacted semantic receipts.

The first and only installed provider is Codex. Dynamic semantic tools remain
undiscoverable unless the hidden server coordinator projects one of the five
same-task read bindings for an already persisted native Codex run. Catalog
membership alone does not grant authority. The server can now create and start
a Codex-backed native run only through the default-off `paperclip_runner`
adapter. See
[`SEMANTIC_ACTIONS.md`](SEMANTIC_ACTIONS.md) for the catalog boundary.

The package has two initial public surfaces:

- `@paperclipai/paperclip-runner` contains runtime contracts, validation,
  replay/reducer logic, the semantic catalog, the authorization dispatcher, and
  the Node-only durable server authority.
- `@paperclipai/paperclip-runner/testing` adds Node-only fixture loading and a
  provider-neutral semantic conformance kit for deterministic test adapters.

No SDK, browser, React, eval, live-console, lab, or provider-experiment entry
point is exported. The package remains private in this wave. The server route
at `/api/runner/v1/connect/:runId` has no authority until the hidden coordinator
registers an exact existing run binding. Fresh native starts are rejected
unless the instance `enableNativeRunner` flag is enabled. Existing direct
adapters keep their original execution path.

The package build compiles the release `paperclip-runnerd` executable and
stages it under `dist/bin`. The normal server build vendors that directory, so
an installed server does not depend on a separate system Rust installation or
a manually copied binary. `pnpm-lock.yaml` remains under the repository's
existing lockfile process.

Run the complete contract gate with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner check:protocol
```

Run the Rust runner gate with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @paperclipai/paperclip-runner check:runner
```

This command checks Rust formatting, builds and tests the minimal workspace in
release mode, verifies bounded process cleanup, launches the real
`paperclip-runnerd` binary through the fake harness, and compares the Rust
conformance and replay summaries with the shared fixtures. The checked-in Cargo
lock and pinned Rust toolchain keep this verification reproducible.

Durability and failure semantics are documented in
[`runner/DURABLE_TRANSPORT.md`](runner/DURABLE_TRANSPORT.md). The fault suite
drops a connection before its event ACK, reconnects with the bound lease,
replays the same event, and proves the duplicated command effect ran once.
Codex launch, resume, cancellation, and normalization behavior is documented in
[`runner/CODEX_PROVIDER.md`](runner/CODEX_PROVIDER.md).

Use `generate:protocol-manifest` after a schema or fixture change,
`generate:protocol-types` after a schema change, and
`generate:replay-goldens` after an intentional reducer change. Commit generated
outputs with their sources; do not edit them by hand.

Use `generate:semantic-action-catalog` after changing a semantic action
declaration. Its checked-in JSON inventory must land with the source change.

The gate compiles every schema with AJV 2020-12, validates accepted fixtures,
rejects unsupported required versions, checks generated TypeScript schema
drift, runs the TypeScript contract tests, and compares reducer snapshots and
parity summaries byte-for-byte with their checked-in golden files.
